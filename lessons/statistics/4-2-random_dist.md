[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?**

When you plot the PMF of the random numbers, the graph is essentially a rectangle fully colored in.  The sample size is too large for a PMF and the range of values is also very small, so it's almost impossible to distinguish between the values.  This also implies that this function isn't truly random since the function is making sure to generate values evenly between 0-1. However, when you plot the CDF of the sample, the CDF is approximately a straight line which means the distribution is uniform. 

<code>Python
    import numpy as np
    import nsfg
    import first
    import thinkstats2
    import thinkplot
    
    one_thousand_randoms = np.random.random(1000)
    
    pmf_randoms = thinkstats2.Pmf(one_thousand_randoms, label='1000 randoms')
    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_randoms)
    
    df_randoms = thinkstats2.Cdf(one_thousand_randoms, label='1000 randoms')
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_randoms)
